# Diabetes Prediction Dataset & App

## Dataset Description

The diabetes dataset is used for predicting whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements. This dataset includes the following features:

- `Pregnancies`: Number of times pregnant
- `Glucose`: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- `BloodPressure`: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- `SkinThickness`: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- `Insulin`: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- `BMI`: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`: Diabetes pedigree function
- `Age`: Age in years
- `Outcome`: Class variable (0 or 1) indicating if the patient has diabetes

The app uses a ML model to to predict whether a new patient, based on these measurements, is likely to have diabetes.
